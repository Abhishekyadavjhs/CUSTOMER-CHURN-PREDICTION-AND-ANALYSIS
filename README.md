# CUSTOMER-CHURN-PREDICTION-AND-ANALYSIS
Analyzed telecom customer data, handled missing values and class imbalance using SMOTE, and built ML models (Decision Tree, Random Forest, XGBoost) to predict customer churn. Saved models with Pickle for deployment-ready solutions.


# Customer Churn Prediction

## Overview

This project focuses on analyzing telecom customer data and predicting whether a customer is likely to leave the service (churn). Using real-world customer data, the project applies machine learning techniques such as Decision Tree, Random Forest, and XGBoost to build predictive models. It also handles challenges like missing data and class imbalance using techniques like data cleaning and SMOTE.

The final trained model is saved using Pickle for future use and deployment. Visualizations such as histograms, boxplots, and correlation heatmaps help understand customer behavior and feature relationships.

This project demonstrates key skills in data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, evaluation, and model serialization â€“ making it a strong addition to any data analyst or machine learning portfolio.
